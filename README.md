# System and method for real-time visual defect detection using multi-agent coordination to improve inspection accuracy

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a method and system for automatically detecting and classifying visual surface defects across various types of products using a cooperative multi-agent reasoning mechanism. The method includes applying an object detection model to identify suspected defect regions within input image sequences, cropping these regions into image patches, and employing a vision-language model to generate semantic descriptions along with confidence scores derived from the object detection model. These descriptions are aggregated into a structured list-based data format. AI agents subsequently analyze the aggregated semantic data to determine a final classification of NG (Not Good) or OK, based on temporal recurrence and semantic consistency of detected defects.
