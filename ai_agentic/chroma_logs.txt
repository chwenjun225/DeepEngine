I need to provide accurate information based on the given text. The key points are:

1. The deficit will be down to less than half of its previous level.
2. The president will be the only one to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.

I should present this information clearly and concisely.

The revenue year of 2024 is expected to be less than half of 2023, and the president will be the only one to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. This information is based on the government's plans for reducing the public debt deficit. Please note that these figures are estimates and may change based on various factors. For the most up-to-date information, please check the official government budget reports.
