School cafeteria apples:\nThe solution is also correct. However, it might be more efficient to simplify the calculation: 23 - 20 = -3 (meaning they lost 3 apples), but then add the new apples: -3 + 6 = 3. Alternatively, you could subtract the used apples first and then add the new ones: 23 + (-20) + 6 = 9.\n\n3. Katie's Halloween candy:\nThe solution is correct. However, it might be more concise to calculate the total number of pieces before eating any: 8 + 23 = 31.\n\n4. Restaurant chicken wings:\nThe solution is correct. If you want to emphasize that each person gets a whole number of wings, you could say: \"There are a total of 16 chicken wings. Since there are 4 people in the group, we can divide 16 by 4 to get an exact quotient.\"\n\n5. Wendy's Facebook pictures:\nThe solution is correct.

Then, divide that number by 5 to find out how many games he could buy: $45 \u00f7 $5 = 9.\n\n8. April's flowers:\nThe solution is correct. However, it might be more efficient to simplify the calculation: First, calculate the total cost of the roses and daisies separately: $42 (roses) + $18 (daisies) = $60.

So if we subtract her score from the total number of points, we can figure out how many other points came from the rest of the players.\n\n41 (total points) - 11 (Paige's points) = 30\n\nNow we need to find out how many points each of the other players scored. We know that everyone else on Paige's team scored 6 points each, but we don't know how many other players there were.\n\nTo figure this out, we can divide the number of remaining points (30) by the number of points each player scored (6). This gives us the following equation:\n\n30 \u00f7 6 = ?\n\nTo solve for x in the equation 30/6=x, we need to find a whole number that will give us the same result when 30 is divided by 6.\n\n30 \u00f7 5 = 6", "pred_ans": "6", "wrap_que": "Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it.

If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make?\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many trays Luke can carry in total: 20 + 16 = 36 trays.\n\nSince Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time, we'll divide the total number of trays (36) by 4:\n\n36 \u00f7 4 = 9\n\nSo, Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

You can turn the lights on and off as many times as you want, but you can only enter the room one time to observe the bulbs. How can you figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb?\n\nThis problem requires a bit more thinking! One possible solution is to turn two switches on for 5 minutes, then turn one of them off. Then, turn both switches back on and immediately go into the room to observe the bulbs. Now, here's how to figure it out:\n\n* If a bulb is on, that switch corresponds to one of the switches you turned on.\n* If a bulb is off but warm (i.e., it was recently turned off), that switch corresponds to the other switch you turned on.\n* If a bulb is off and cold (i.e., it's been off for a while), that switch corresponds to the switch you just turned off.\n\nSo, by observing the bulbs' states after this sequence of events, you can figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb.

Most problems follow the \"Let's think step by step\" format, which is great for young learners to understand the process of solving math problems.\n3. Some problems have straightforward solutions, while others require a bit more critical thinking.\n\nNow, I'll review each problem and provide feedback:\n\n1. Bianca's bookcase: Correct solution. Each shelf has 8 books, with 5 shelves of mystery books (40) and 4 shelves of picture books (32). Total = 72 books.\n2. Apples in the cafeteria: Correct solution. Initial amount + purchased apples = 29 apples.\n3. Katie and her sister's candy: Correct solution. Combined candy - eaten = 23 pieces left.\n4. Chicken wings for the restaurant group: Correct solution. Divided the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of people in the group (4) to find out each person would get 4 chicken wings.\n5. Pictures on Facebook: Incorrect solution. Wendy uploaded a total of 45 pictures, but put 27 into one album and 18 into 9 different albums. To find out how many pictures were in each album, divide 18 by 9 (2 pictures per album).\n6.

{"question": "Q: Tom was putting his spare change into piles. He had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. If each pile had 5 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?\nA:", "gold_ans": "30", "rationale": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\nTom had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. Since each pile has 5 coins in it, we need to find out how many coins are in a quarter and how many coins are in a dime.\n\nA quarter is worth $0.25, so if Tom had x number of quarters, he would have 0.25x dollars. Since each pile has 5 coins, the total amount of money in each pile of quarters is 0.25x * 5 = $1.25x. Similarly, a dime is worth $0.10, so if Tom had y number of dimes, he would have 0.10y dollars. Since each pile has 5 coins, the total amount of money in each pile of dimes is 0.10y * 5 = $0.50y.\n\nSince Tom has 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes, we can write an equation:\n\n$1.25x + $0.50y = ?\n\nWe know that the total amount of money Tom had is unknown, so let's call it z. Since each pile has 5 coins, the total number of coins in both types of piles is:\n\n2 * 5 (quarters) + 4 * 5 (dimes) = 10 + 20 = 30 coins\n\nSo, we can write another equation:\n\nx + y = 30\n\nWe need to solve these two equations to find x and y. We can use substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n$2.50x + $1.00y = ?\n\nNow subtract this new equation from the second one (x + y = 30):\n\n($1.25x - $2.50x) + ($0.50y - $1.00y) = 30 - 30\n- $1.25x - $0.50y = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -1 to simplify:\n\n$1.25x + $0.50y = 0\n\nNow we have a single equation with two variables, but it has no solution because the coefficients of x and y are equal, so the equations are dependent. This means that there is only one possible value for either x or y.\n\nLet's try to find x:\n$1.25x + $0.50y = 0\n$1.25x = -$0.50y\nx = -0.4y\n\nSince x and y must be whole numbers (we can't have a fraction of a coin), we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy the equation.\n\nIf y = 20, then x = -8 (which is not possible since you can't have negative quarters).\nIf y = 15, then x = -6 (still not possible).\nIf y = 10, then x = -4 (not possible either).\n\nWait a minute... This problem has no solution. We can't find the exact number of coins Tom had because we are given two conditions that cannot be met at the same time.\n\nThe answer is \"no solution\".", "pred_ans": "", "wrap_que": "Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it.

If she deleted 23 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?\n\nSince Amy can't delete more files than she has, we know that deleting 23 files is not possible.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem to understand what Amy actually did:\n\nAmy had 4 music files and 21 video files. She deleted some files, but we don't know how many. We know that the total number of files she deleted can't be more than the sum of her music and video files: 4 + 21 = 25.\n\nHowever, we are told that Amy deleted 23 files. Since this is less than the maximum possible, let's calculate the new total:\n\nLet x be the number of files Amy deleted from the music files:\nMusic files left: 4 - x\nVideo files left: 21 - (23 - x) = 21 - 23 + x = -2 + x\n\nThe problem states that Amy deleted a certain number of files, so we can't determine how many files were deleted. However, we know that the total number of files on her flash drive after deletion is less than or equal to 25:\n\n(4 - x) + (-2 + x) <= 25\nSimplifies to: 2 <= 25\n\nThis statement is true for all values of x.\n\nThe answer cannot be determined with the information given.", "pred_ans": "25", "wrap_que": "Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it.

I'll go through each one and provide the solution.\n\n1. A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked 7 more for the group. If they each got the same amount, how many would each person get?\n\nSolution: There are a total of 16 chicken wings (9 + 7). Since there are 4 people in the group, each person will get 1/4 of the 16 chicken wings, which is 4 chicken wings.\n\n2. Wendy uploaded 45 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 9 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?\n\nSolution: First, we know that Wendy uploaded 45 pictures in total.

If the school cafeteria started with 23 apples, used 20, and then bought 6 more, they should have:\n\n23 (initial apples) - 20 (used apples) = 3\n3 + 6 (new apples) = 9\n\nSo, the correct answer is 9.\n\nQ: Katie and her sister combined the candy they received... \nA: ...The answer is 23.\n\nThis solution seems correct, but it would be helpful to provide more context about what happens when they eat some of the candy.\n\nQ: A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant... \nA: ...Each person would get 4 chicken wings. The answer is 4.\n\nThis solution appears to be incorrect. If there are 16 chicken wings in total and each friend gets an equal share, each person should get:\n\n16 (total wings) / 4 (number of friends) = 4 wings per friend\n\nHowever, this assumes that the remaining 7 wings will also be divided equally among the friends. To determine the correct answer, we need to subtract the initial 9 wings from the total number of wings and divide by the number of friends:\n\n16 (total wings) - 9 (initial wings) = 7\n7 / 4 (number of friends) = 1.75\n\nSince you can't divide a chicken wing into fractions, we can assume that each friend will get one whole chicken wing and possibly some remaining wings that are divided among the friends.\n\nTo determine how many wings each person gets, let's recalculate the number of wings:\n\n16 (total wings) - 9 (initial wings) = 7\nSince there are 4 friends, we can divide the remaining wings by 4:\n7 / 4 = 1.75\n\nHowever, since you can't divide a chicken wing into fractions, we can assume that each friend will get one whole chicken wing and possibly some remaining wings that are divided among the friends.\n\nTo determine how many wings each person gets, let's recalculate the number of wings:\n\n16 (total wings) - 9 (initial wings) = 7\nSince there are 4 friends, we can divide the remaining wings by 4:\n7 / 4 = 1.75\n\nHowever, since you can't divide a chicken wing into fractions, we can assume that each friend will get one whole chicken wing and possibly some remaining wings that are divided among the friends.\n\nQ: Wendy uploaded 45 pictures to Facebook... \nA: ...Each album would have 2 pictures. The answer is 2.\n\nThis solution appears to be incorrect. If Wendy put 27 pictures into one album and had 18 pictures left, she could divide them into 9 albums as follows:\n\n18 (remaining pictures) / 9 (number of albums) = 2\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 2.\n\nQ: A trivia team had 7 members total... \nA: ...The total number of points scored would be 20. The answer is 20.\n\nThis solution appears to be incorrect. If there were only 5 members who showed up and each member scored 4 points, the correct calculation would be:\n\n5 (number of members) x 4 (points per member) = 20\n\nHowever, this assumes that all 7 members initially participated in the game. To determine the correct answer, we need more information about which members did not show up.\n\nQ: Mike made $69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer... \nA: ...He could buy 9 games. The answer is 9.\n\nThis solution appears to be incorrect. If Mike spent $24 on new mower blades, he would have:\n\n$69 (total earnings) - $24 (mower blades) = $45\n\nSince each game costs $5, the correct calculation would be:\n\n$45 / $5 (game price) = 9 games\n\nHowever, this assumes that Mike can afford to buy more games. To determine if he actually has enough money for 9 games, we need to calculate how much he spent on games.\n\nQ: The school cafeteria had 23 apples... \nA: ...The answer is 29.\n\nThis solution appears to be incorrect. If the school cafeteria started with 23 apples, used 20, and then bought 6 more, they should have:\n\n23 (initial apples) - 20 (used apples) = 3\n3 + 6 (new apples) = 9\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 9.\n\nHere are some additional problems you can try to solve:\n\n* A bookshelf has 5 shelves.
