# Intelligent Weekly Report Agent software requirements-240731

## Purpose: Use AI-Agent to replace simple and repetitive tasks of humans, giving humans the opportunity to engage in higher-value tasks

Example of software job steps:
1. Every Wednesday at VN 14:00, the Agent reminds (WeChat and email) team members to submit weekly reports at 16:00 PM on Thursday, hold weekly department meetings every Saturday at 9:00 AM, and automatically apply for a Webex account (conference room);
2. Agent intelligently downloads the weekly report every Thursday at 16:30, intelligently scores the format and content of each weekly report, and makes a statistical list;
3. Every Thursday at 17:00, Agent will report the unqualified weekly and notify the reporter (WeChat and email) to make changes.  Reporters must submit before 14:00 on Friday;
4. Every Friday at 14:30 Agent intelligently scores the format and content of the weekly report received and submits a statistical list;
5. Agent merges the qualified weekly reports into the AI team’s internal weekly report PPT.
6. Agent selects the important contents of the internal weekly report PPT and makes an external weekly report PPT according to the format of the external weekly report;
7. Every Friday at 15:00 Agent sends the AI team’s internal weekly report and external weekly report to the AI director for review;
8. After the AI supervisor passes the review, the external weekly report will be automatically sent to the relevant supervisor via email.
9. Agent will collect attendance list of members through Webex or on-site roll call at 9:00 every Saturday.
10. Agent downloads the weekly meeting score sheet every Saturday at 11:00 and calculates the members’ scores for the week.  Member's score for the week = weekly meeting score * 0.8 + weekly report Agent score * 0.1 + weekly report submission score on time on Friday * 0.1 = 0 to 50 points.
11. Agent will display the names and scores of the top three through WeChat every Saturday at 11:10, and hide the list of the rest.

Promotion path: First make an AI intelligent weekly report Agent, and then copy and promote it to other departments.  Normally every department has a weekly report, and the demand for this Agent is expected to be huge.
Business value: Save about 8 hours per week, which means saving 10,000 yuan/year. CNS has about 300 PMs or assistants with similar functions, which means saving 3M yuan/year.
Please estimate the approximate development time.
