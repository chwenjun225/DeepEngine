Yes, there is a growing body of research exploring the concept of using AI to create or enhance other AI models. This approach, often referred to as "AutoML" (Automated Machine Learning), involves AI systems that can design, optimize, and even train other AI models with minimal human intervention.

**Key Developments in AI-Generated AI:**

1. **Reinforcement Learning for Model Optimization:**
   - Researchers have applied reinforcement learning techniques to enable AI systems to optimize neural network architectures. For instance, a study published in *Nature* discusses how AI models can collapse when trained on recursively generated data, highlighting the importance of careful design in AI-generated AI systems. citeturn0search0

2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
   - GANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—that are trained together. The generator creates data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity. This adversarial process leads to the generation of increasingly realistic data, which can be used to train other AI models. The *Wikipedia* article on GANs provides an overview of this technique. citeturn0search15

3. **AI-Assisted Scientific Research:**
   - AI systems have been developed to generate original research ideas and hypotheses. A study reported in *Nature* found that an AI-powered ideas generator produced more original research concepts than human researchers, suggesting that AI can contribute significantly to scientific innovation. citeturn0search1

4. **Efficient AI Model Development:**
   - Companies like DeepSeek have introduced AI models that utilize reinforcement learning and other techniques to build powerful AI systems with less computational resources. DeepSeek's R1 model, for example, achieved competitive performance using less sophisticated hardware, demonstrating the potential for AI to optimize AI development. citeturn0news10

These advancements indicate a significant trend toward AI systems capable of creating and refining other AI models, potentially leading to more efficient and innovative developments in the field.
