Great — wireless and semiconductor research is both cutting-edge and foundational for the future of computing, connectivity, and energy efficiency. Here are tailored project ideas for each area, and one that combines both:

---

### **1. Wireless Communication Focus**

**Project Title:** *“6G mmWave and THz Channel Modeling for Smart Cities”*

* **Objective:** Develop accurate channel models for high-frequency (millimeter-wave to terahertz) wireless communication in urban environments, considering mobility, blockage, and multipath effects.
* **Tools:** MATLAB, CST/HFSS, ray tracing simulators, machine learning for model optimization.
* **Why:** 6G will rely heavily on these bands for ultra-high data rates, and modeling is critical for efficient protocol design.

### **2. Semiconductor Focus**

**Project Title:** *“Design of Ultra-Low Power FinFET-based Neuromorphic Circuits”*

* **Objective:** Explore circuit-level design of energy-efficient neuromorphic computing units using FinFET or Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors.
* **Tools:** Cadence Virtuoso, SPICE, Synopsys TCAD.
* **Why:** There is a massive push toward brain-inspired, low-power AI hardware as Moore’s Law slows.

### **3. Cross-Domain: Wireless + Semiconductor**

**Project Title:** *“RF Energy Harvesting IC for Self-Powered IoT Nodes”*

* **Objective:** Design a CMOS-based RF energy harvesting chip that can power IoT sensors using ambient wireless signals (Wi-Fi, 5G, TV).
* **Includes:** Antenna co-design, power management, low-dropout regulators (LDO), and rectifier design.
* **Why:** It enables batteryless, maintenance-free sensors — ideal for smart homes, agriculture, and industrial IoT.
