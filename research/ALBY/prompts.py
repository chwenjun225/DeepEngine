Reasoning Agent: Alice is older than Bob and Bob is older than Carol. This means Alice is older than both Bob and Carol, so Alice is the oldest.

Planning Agent: Objective: Build a birdhouse. Plan: First, gather materials like wood, nails, and tools. Next, sketch a simple design for the birdhouse.

Instruction: "Calculate 15/3."
Execution Agent: The agent performs the calculation and responds with "5" (the result of 15 divided by 3). If the instruction were impossible (e.g. "calculate 10/0"), the Execution Agent would report an error instead of a result.

Input (technical): Quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in superposition (both 0 and 1 simultaneously), enabling parallel computations far beyond classical computers.
Communication Agent: In simple terms, quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This property allows them to perform certain calculations much faster than regular computers. (The Communication Agent has stripped away extra jargon and explained the concept clearly.)

Issue: Application crash with error NullPointerException at line 45.
Debugging Agent: The error indicates something was null at line 45, meaning a variable wasn’t initialized. I trace the code and find that userData was never set before use.
